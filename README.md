# Upgradeable smart contracts

This project is for experimentation purposes implementing a simple proxy pattern
in order to make smart contracts upgradeable.

A great tutorial on upgradeable smart contracts can be found [here](https://jeiwan.net/posts/upgradeable-proxy-from-scratch/)

Hardhat is used as development and test environment.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
